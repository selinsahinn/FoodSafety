🥗 FoodSafety – Full Stack Web Application with Custom Blockchain Logic

🎓 This project was developed as my graduation project for the Computer Engineering program at Sakarya University.

FoodSafety is a full stack web application that tracks food product operations using a custom-built blockchain structure on the backend.
The main goal is to ensure product traceability and safety, by recording each step in a secure and immutable chain of operations. This allows the system to determine whether a product is safe or unsafe based on its operation history.

🔐 Key Feature
✅ Custom blockchain logic developed from scratch in Java (Spring Boot)

🔍 Ensures data integrity and product traceability throughout the food lifecycle

⚙️ Technologies Used
Frontend: React (Hooks, Functional Components)

Backend: Java 17 + Spring Boot

Database: MySQL

ORM: Spring Data JPA / Hibernate

HTTP: Fetch

IDE: IntelliJ IDEA (backend), VS Code (frontend)

🚀 How to Run the Project
🔧 Backend (Spring Boot)
Open the project in IntelliJ IDEA (or any compatible IDE).

Update application.properties with your own:

MySQL username, password, and database name.

Make sure MySQL server is running.

Run the Spring Boot application.
→ Runs on port: 8080

🌐 Frontend (React)
Navigate to the React project folder.

Run:
npm install
npm run start
→ Runs on: http://localhost:3000

🛢️ Database
MySQL runs on port 3306

Database schema setup script will be provided (or you can create it manually for now)

🎥 Demo
A short video showing how the application works (including blockchain operation tracking) will be added to the repository soon.
